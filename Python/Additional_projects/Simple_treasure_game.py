Chamber of Fortune ‚Äì Text-Based Treasure Game

A fantasy-themed mini-game in which the player explores a mysterious chamber
through five forward steps. At each step, there's a chance to find a chest 
of varying color and value ‚Äî or nothing at all.

Chest colors are ranked by rarity: green (common), orange (uncommon), purple (rare), and gold (very rare).
The gold reward increases quadratically with rarity. The player‚Äôs goal is to collect
as much gold as possible before the game ends.

Game mechanics:
1. The player has 5 steps to make.
2. At each step, the game randomly determines if a chest or nothing is found.
3. If a chest is found, its color is determined randomly based on rarity.
4. The corresponding reward is added to the player's total gold.

Chest reward scheme:
- Green:   1¬≤ √ó 1000 = 1000 gold
- Orange:  2¬≤ √ó 1000 = 4000 gold
- Purple:  3¬≤ √ó 1000 = 9000 gold
- Gold:    4¬≤ √ó 1000 = 16000 gold

Dependencies:
- random
- enum

Output:
- Step-by-step messages guiding the player through the chamber
- Total gold acquired at the end of the game

‚ú® Story intro (in-game):
You enter a mysterious chamber where every step forward could uncover treasure...
or nothing at all. You have 5 steps to make ‚Äî how much gold will you collect
before the chamber closes forever?
