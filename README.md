## 🧬 Code-storage

This folder contains **Python** code and an **SQL** file.
Most of the files are related to projects carried out during my PhD. They relate to analyses associated with a mouse model of promiscuous breast cancer and to a substance being tested as a potential drug: Pyrvinium Pamoate. 
> This is only a marginal part of the biostatistical analyses and visualisations that have been carried out.
